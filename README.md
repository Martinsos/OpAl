# Swimd

Swimd is C/C++ library for fast query vs database sequence alignment using SSE.  
Swimd is implemented mainly by Rognes's "Faster Smith-Waterman database searches with inter-sequence SIMD parallelisation".  
Main difference is that Swimd offers 4 alignment modes instead of just Smith-Waterman.

#### Requirements
SSE4.1 or higher.
If AVX2 is available, Swimd will consume two times more sequences and will therefore work two times faster.
By compiling code with makefile and running ./test, you can see if you have SSE4.1 or AVX2 and also see if everything is working.

#### Alignment modes
Swimd offers 4 different modes of alignment: 1 local and 3 global modes, explained below.
* SW: Local alignment (Smith-Waterman).
* NW: Global alignment (Needleman-Wunsch).
* HW: Semi-global alignment. Insertions before query start and insertions after query end are not penalized.
* OV: Semi-global alignment. Insertions before start of either query or target and insertions after end of either query or target are not penalized.

#### Usage
To use Swimd you just have to include Swimd.h in your code and compile your code together with Swimd.cpp using appropriate compiler flag for SSE, for example -msse4.1 (or just use -march which will detect your arhitecture and will also use appropriate SSE flag).  

```
...
#include "Swimd.h"
...
```

```
...
int alphabetLength = 4;
int gapOpen = 3;
int gapExt = 1;
int scoreMatrix[16] = {
    2, -1, -3, 0,
    -1, 4, -5, -1,
    -3, -5, 1, -10,
    0, -1, -10, 4
};

int queryLength = 10;
unsigned char query[10] = {0,1,3,2,1,0,3,0,1,1};

int dbLength = 4;
unsigned char dbSeq1[14] = {1,3,2,3,0,0,1,0,2,2,1,2,3,2};
unsigned char dbSeq2[12] = {2,1,1,3,2,0,0,2,2,0,2,1};
unsigned char dbSeq3[13] = {0,0,2,1,0,3,1,1,2,3,2,1,0};
unsigned char dbSeq4[9] = {2,3,3,3,1,1,2,2,0};
unsigned char* db[4] = { dbSeq1, dbSeq2, dbSeq3, dbSeq4 };
int dbSeqsLengths[4] = {14, 12, 13, 9};

int scores[4];
int resultCode = swimdSearchDatabase(query, queryLength, db, dbLength, dbSeqsLengths, 
                                     gapOpen, gapExt, scoreMatrix, alphabetLength, scores, SWIMD_MODE_SW);
printf("%d %d %d %d\n", scores[0], scores[1], scores[2], scores[3]);
...
```

For more examples of usage take a look at test.cpp and swimd_aligner.cpp.

## Swimd aligner
In order to compile and use simple aligner that uses Swimd run makefile in src:

    cd src
    make swimd_aligner
    
Type `./swimd_aligner` for help.

Examples of usage:

    ./swimd_aligner ../test_data/query/O74807.fasta ../test_data/db/uniprot_sprot12071.fasta
    ./swimd_aligner -s ../test_data/query/P18080.fasta ../test_data/db/uniprot_sprot12071.fasta
    ./swimd_aligner -s -a NW ../test_data/query/P18080.fasta ../test_data/db/uniprot_sprot12071.fasta
    
#### Test data
In test_data/ there are two directories, query/ and db/.
In query/ are fasta files with one sequence each, while in db/ are fasta files with many sequences each.
All fasta files were obtained from www.uniprot.org.
File in db/ with name uniprot_sprotN.fasta was generated by taking first N sequences from uniprot_sprot.fasta, which can be found at www.uniprot.org/downloads -> UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot.
