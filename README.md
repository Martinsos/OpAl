# Swimd

Swimd is C/C++ library for fast query vs database sequence alignment using SSE.  
Swimd is implemented mainly by Rognes's "Faster Smith-Waterman database searches with inter-sequence SIMD parallelisation".  
Main difference is that Swimd offers 4 alignment modes instead of just Smith-Waterman.

#### Requirements
SSE4.1 or higher.

#### Alignment modes
Swimd offers 4 different modes of alignment: 1 local and 3 global modes, explained below.
* SW: Local alignment (Smith-Waterman).
* NW: Global alignment (Needleman-Wunsch).
* HW: Semi-global alignment. Gap at query start and gap at query end are not penalized.
* OV: Semi-global alignment. Gap at query start, gap at query end, gap at target start and gap at target end are not penalized.

#### Usage
To use Swimd you just have to include swimd.h in your code and compile it together with swimd.cpp.  
For examples of usage take a look at test.cpp and swimd_aligner.cpp.

## Swimd aligner
In order to compile and use simple aligner that uses Swimd run makefile in src:

    cd src
    make swimd_aligner
    
Type `./swimd_aligner` for help.

Examples of usage:

    ./swimd_aligner ../test_data/query/O74807.fasta ../test_data/db/uniprot_sprot12071.fasta
    ./swimd_aligner -s ../test_data/query/P18080.fasta ../test_data/db/uniprot_sprot12071.fasta
    ./swimd_aligner -s -a NW ../test_data/query/P18080.fasta ../test_data/db/uniprot_sprot12071.fasta
    
#### Test data
In test_data/ there are two directories, query/ and db/.
In query/ are fasta files with one sequence each, while in db/ are fasta files with many sequences each.
All fasta files were obtained from www.uniprot.org.
File in db/ with name uniprot_sprotN.fasta was generated by taking first N sequences from uniprot_sprot.fasta, which can be found at www.uniprot.org/downloads -> UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot.
